# 🏛️ Building a professional data science template for regulatory reporting
On my [resume](https://nathanwatkinsdc.github.io/resume/), I highlight one of my recent accomplishments at work, a fraud monitoring system that I’m unfortunately unable to showcase on this site because of restrictions around the sharing of controlled information. What I can do, however, is start from scratch to create my very own comprehensive, reusable template for automated regulatory reporting projects. This template, which I’ve shared on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nathanwatkinsdc/automated-report-template), is my own creation and isn’t just another data science boilerplate—it’s a production-ready framework designed specifically for the unique challenges of regulatory work.

## 🎯 The challenge: scaling regulatory analytics
I started with an automated reporting system using Python, Jupyter notebooks, and Plotly to process loan-level data from financial institutions. My workflow transformed raw CSV files into polished PDF reports with tables, charts, and maps—all formatted for stakeholders like leadership, other analysts, etc. But there was a problem: I needed to replicate my framework across multiple projects and prepare it for public portfolio demonstrations like this one. That meant creating a template that was **reusable** and maintainable by other people.

## 🧠 The solution: a modular regulatory framework
Guided by a little research on best practices, I took a turn toward a complete folder structure and starter codebase that separated concerns cleanly:

```
automated_report_project/
├── 00_data/                      # Raw and cleaned data
├── 01_notebooks/                 # Jupyter analysis by section  
├── 02_modules/                   # Reusable Python modules
├── 03_output/                    # Draft and final reports
├── 04_config/                    # Project configuration
├── README.md                     # Complete documentation
└── requirements.txt              # Python dependencies
```

## 🔧 The technical architecture
The ❤️ of my system is four core Python modules:

1. **`report_utils.py`** handles all the heavy lifting for automated exports. It saves figures with timestamped subdirectories, formats Excel tables with professional styling, and includes a `generate_all_outputs()` function that rebuilds everything with a single command. I’m really proud of this module because it includes so many handy functions, bells, and whistles.
2. **`cleaning.py`** provides comprehensive data preprocessing—from promoting headers and parsing dates to standardizing loan IDs and validating numeric ranges. It includes specialized functions for loan-level data that understand the quirks of GSE reporting.
3. **`validation.py`** implements business rule validation and data quality assessment. It flags records with missing critical fields, validates date logic (like ensuring origination dates come before maturity dates), and generates comprehensive quality reports with actionable recommendations.
4. **`visuals.py`** creates standardized visualizations with consistent enterprise styling. Think choropleth maps normalized by loan exposure, time series with dual axes, and horizontal bar charts—all using a consistent blue/orange color scheme assuming two enterprises/financial institutions. 

## 🎨 The details that matter
There are so many professional touches that make my template special:

- **Figure naming conventions**: `fig_2b_sar_volume_by_state.png`
- **Enterprise color consistency** across all visualizations
- **Automated timestamping** for version control
- **Cross-platform compatibility** using pathlib instead of os.path
- **Print-to-PDF automation** for final deliverables
- **Comprehensive docstrings** for maintainability

Do you ever crack open a colleague’s work and take a big sigh of relief because the quality is just that high? That’s the moment I had in mind when designing this template. 

## 📊 Built for government standards
Again, I wasn’t going for just any data science template—I wanted one for the regulatory environment:

- **Data validation rules** for loan amounts, interest rates, and date consistency
- **Geographic visualizations** with proper state standardization
- **Fraud analysis components** with BSA ID validation
- **Quality reporting** that meets government documentation standards
- **Professional styling** appropriate for senior leadership presentations

## 🚀 Ready for production
My template includes everything needed for immediate deployment:

- Complete **requirements.txt** with all dependencies
- **Sample Jupyter notebook** demonstrating the full workflow
- **Built-in testing functions** for all major components
- **Configuration management** for different data sources
- **Comprehensive README** with setup instructions

My goal was to be able to replicate my reporting framework across projects in minutes instead of weeks, and while I can’t connect this framework with enterprise data, I’m confident I achieved my goal ✅ I’m also confident my framework is ready for use and maintenance by others without the need to understand every implementation detail ✅

## 💡 The bigger picture
This project, like the blog I’m posting this write-up on, is a sign of a growing passion of mine: making advanced analytics more accessible. By creating reusable templates with professional documentation, I want to help agencies modernize their analytical capabilities while maintaining the quality and compliance standards they require.
