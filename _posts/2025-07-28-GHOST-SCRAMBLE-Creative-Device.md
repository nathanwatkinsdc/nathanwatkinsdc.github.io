# 🔮 Introducing GHOST SCRAMBLE: A Creative Device for Multidimensional Thinking

## 🤒 How it began: a cure for writer’s block
There was a time, back when I was immersed in German literature somewhere around the ages of 18-22, where I flirted with the idea of being a writer. I constantly had a journal in my hand and ink stains on my fingers.

During that period, I developed a custom creative writing device called BMGMELTC. Basically, this was an acronym for a string of German words, each one corresponding to a category of ideas from which I’d pull one out of my mind and write next to the letter at the top of a journal page. Once I’d written one idea per letter, I’d start an entry.

Sometimes, my entries would converge to one of the ideas I’d selected from BMGMELTC, and sometimes, a story would form connecting multiple or even all of them. And yet, sometimes, I could hardly tell what the connection was between the ideas I’d selected for each of the letters and the words underneath them. However, one thing was for certain: once I’d filled out BMGMELTC, I had no trouble writing. It was the cure for writer’s block.

## 🔨From BMGMELTC to GHOST SCRAMBLE
I used BMGMELTC for many years, and then I spent as many years not writing. When I got back around to it, I felt out of touch with BMGMELTC and found the acronym clunky and in need of a revamp, so I decided to build a proper acronym with a literal meaning. Since I was also working through some memories (ghosts?) from the past at the time, I landed at GHOST SCRAMBLE:

### 🧩 Elements of GHOST SCRAMBLE
Here is what the letters mean in my GHOST SCRAMBLE creative device:

- **G – Gedanke (Thought):** the seed of the idea; the concept, philosophy, or question at the center.
- **H – Herz (Heart):** the emotional core; the feelings underneath; the pulse below.
- **O – Objekt (Object):** a tangible thought anchor—real or imagined, symbolic or mundane—that holds meaning.
- **S – Stimmung (Mood):** the atmosphere, emotional weather, or tone.
- **T – Text:** a written piece, real or imagined, serving as a reference or inspiration (e.g., prose, poem, mantra, fragment, script).

- **S – Symbol (Logo):** an emblem, icon, or mark (drawn or described in words).
- **C – Crux of the Matter:** a tension, paradox, or question that can’t be escaped; the thing at stake.
- **R – Richtung (Direction):** a specific trajectory, movement, or orientation; where something is headed or drawn toward. 
- **A – Abwesenheit (Absence):** what’s missing, withheld, or lost; the negative space.
- **M – Mensch (Person):** a human presence (real or imagined, familiar or unknown).
- **B – Bild (Picture):** a visual scene or image-world.
- **L – Lied (Song):** a sound, melody, or rhythm.
- **E – Erinnerungsort (Memory Place):** a location tied to memory or feeling, real or invented.

## ❓Okay, but what… is… GHOST SCRAMBLE
Taking a step back, GHOST SCRAMBLE is a conceptual engine — a map, ritual, and provocation. It’s a way of thinking that invites me (or you!) to explore my (your) work from thirteen distinct but interconnected angles. I use it to write, but I figure you could use it to write, compose, design, reflect, or make art using any kind of medium. My hypothesis is that the device helps by **scrambling** your habitual routes and allowing you to discover new ones.

## 🧑‍🔬 How GHOST SCRAMBLE works 
Each letter in the name stands for a metaphorical portal—a domain through which an idea or project can be refracted. You can use GHOST SCRAMBLE in any order. That’s the point—it’s a scramble, not a sequence. Let it disrupt your project. If you’re stuck on a project, choose an element at random and answer it honestly. If you’re starting it fresh, go through each one as a kind of sketchbook. If you’re revising, use it to spot what’s missing.

Sometimes, like I said before, one element will dominate. Sometimes one will refuse to speak. That’s all part of the dialogue! The device doesn’t five answers—it gives angles.

## 🌱 Why I made GHOST SCRAMBLE
Well, it all started a long time ago organically as BMGMELTC, but I revamped the device as GHOST SCRAMBLE because I still needed a structure that was flexible enough to follow me into different creative forms—writing, visual art, music, theory—but focused enough to push me forward when I got stuck. GHOST SCRAMBLE is my attempt to blend logic and intuition, memory and invention. It’s a way to hold space for complexity without getting lost in it.

If you’re someone who lives in ideas but longs for movement… if you want to go deeper without drowning… if you’re tired of frameworks that treat art like product… and, yet, if you’re like me and you believe that sometimes the most creative works emerge from under constraints… then GHOST SCRAMBLE might be worth exploring.

## 🏃 Try out GHOST SCRAMBLE
When you have a chance, try it out. Break it. Rewrite it. Let it inspire you, haunt you, change you—all at the same time.
