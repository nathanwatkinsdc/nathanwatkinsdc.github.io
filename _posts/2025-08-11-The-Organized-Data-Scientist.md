# 📊 The Organized Data Scientist: Maximizing Impact with a Battle-Tested Project Template

Back when I was an exchange student in Germany, my host mother had a saying she’d like to repeat whenever my room was messy, “Wer Ordnung hält, spart Fantasie” (He who keeps order saves imagination). Back then, the saying pushed my buttons, but these days, I’ve learned the hard way that organization isn’t just nice to have—it’s the difference between projects that ship and projects that die in development.

In 2023 and 2024, I served as [president of the union](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2024/02/federal-housing-finance-agency-to-kickstart-negotiations-for-first-ever-union-contract/) I started at the federal financial regulator where I worked, and during that time I watched more than one well-intentioned initiative fail not because of poor ideas, but because of poor structure. The same principle applies to data science, where a methodical, reproducible approach doesn’t stifle creativity—it amplifies it by removing friction and uncertainty.

Today, I’m open-sourcing the project template I’ve refined through years of hands-on experience. Whether you’re a solo practitioner or a team lead, this structure will save you hours of setup time and prevent the “where did I put that file?” moments that plague even the most experienced professionals.

## 🏢 Why structure matters
In my federal work, I’ve seen data projects collapse under their own wait. Brilliant analysts would create models that worked perfectly until they needed to reproduce results six months later. Teams would waste days hunting for the “final” version of a dataset. Stakeholders would lose confidence when presentations couldn’t be updated because the underlying code was a maze of untraceable dependencies 😵‍💫

In my federal work, I've seen data science projects collapse under their own weight. Brilliant analysts would create models that worked perfectly... until they needed to reproduce results six months later. Teams would waste days hunting for the "final" version of a dataset. Stakeholders would lose confidence when presentations couldn't be updated because the underlying code was a maze of untraceable dependencies.

My template addresses these real-world pin points:

- **Reproducibility**: every step is documented and isolated
- **Collaboration**: team members can jump in without archaeological work
- **Scalability**: structure scales from exploration to production
- **Maintenance**: future you (and your colleagues) will thank present you

If you’re an R user, you’re in luck because I have a template structure for you too.

## Key Design Principles
I followed a few guiding principles in putting together this structure:

1. **Separation of concerns:** each directory serves a specific purpose. Raw data stays raw, and code is separated by function. This isn’t academic theory—it’s a practical necessity when projects grow complex.
2. **Language agnostic foundation:** while I work in Python these days, this structure accommodates R, SQL, or other tools. The key is consistency in organization, not technology lock-in.
3. **Configuration-driven development:** all project settings live in `config/config.yaml`. Database connections, model parameters, file paths—everything configurable is externalized. This makes environment transitions seamless.
4. **Testing from day one:** the `tests/` directory isn’t an afterthought. Building testing habits early prevents painful rewrites later so that “quick analyses” don’t become critical systems (I’ve seen that too many times).

## 🖇️ Workflow integration
My structure supports the complete data science lifecycle:

1. **Exploration** starts in `notebooks/01-data-exploration/`
2. **Stable code** gets refactored into `src/` modules
3. **Experiments** are tracked in `models/experiments/`
4. **Final models** move to `models/production/`
5. **Results** are documented in `reports/`

The beauty is that each phase builds on the previous one without breaking existing work 🎨

## 🏁 Getting started
To get started using my template: 

1. **Clone the template** from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nathanwatkinsdc/project-folder-structure-template)
2. **Run the setup script**: `make setup`
3. **Customize the configuration** for your project
4. **Start exploring** in the notebooks directory

The first few projects will feel like overhead. By the fifth project, you'll wonder how you ever worked without structure. By the tenth, you'll be customizing the template for your specific domain.

## 🧑‍🏫 Lessons from the trenches

After years of working across mathematical, technological, and organizational domains, I've learned that the best processes are invisible. They should support (not constrain) your thinking. 

The goal isn't to follow this template like doctrine—it's to adapt it to your needs while maintaining the core principles: reproducibility, modularity, and clarity.

Now, what about **next steps**? This template is living documentation, so I’ll continue evolving it. For example, in the R template that I linked below the folder structure, I’ve already started adding in some starter code that isn’t included in my Python files. 

I’d love to hear how you adapt the template for your work. What works? What doesn’t? What’s missing? Drop me a line or contribute to the GitHub repository. After all, the best templates are built by the community that uses them.
