<!-- This file is now primarily handled by blog.html layout and Jekyll pagination -->
<!-- The actual blog listing and pagination logic is in blog.html -->


<!-- The code below is how the page used to work before pagination was added in -->
<!--

{% for post in site.posts %}
- [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url }}) - {{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}
{% endfor %}
